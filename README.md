## Sudoku Puzzle in React

This is my first attempt at creating an app in React. Utilizing several resources from reactjs.org to help understand how to utilize components, props and state to accomplish the task at hand. The basic idea of a Sudoku is as follows:

1) Only one number from 1-9 is allowed on each row
2) Only one number from 1-9 is allowed on each column
3) Only one number from 1-9 is allowed in each grid

The goal of the game is to find the missing numbers in the grid such that all three of these conditions are satisfied and if they are then you have successfully completed the puzzle. If not, then you must backtrack and find out which numbers are inserted incorrectly.
